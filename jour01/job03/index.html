In this update, the message "Hello JavaScript from script.js!" is logged to the web
 console using console.log() instead of being displayed in a pop-up alert.

To view the message, you can open your web browser's developer tools 
(usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect"), 
and navigate to the "Console" tab. When you open "index.html" in your browser, 
you should see the message printed in the console.
